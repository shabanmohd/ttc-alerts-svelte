            ## Automated Route Data Refresh

            This PR was automatically created by the weekly route data refresh workflow.

            ### Changes
            The following files were updated from the NextBus API:
            - `src/lib/data/ttc-route-stop-orders.json`
            - `static/data/ttc-route-stop-orders.json`
            - `src/lib/data/ttc-route-branches.json`
            - `static/data/ttc-route-branches.json`

            ### Review Checklist
            - [ ] Check that route counts are similar to before
            - [ ] Spot-check a few routes for stop counts
            - [ ] Verify no unexpected routes were removed

            ### Testing
            After merging, verify on https://version-b.ttc-alerts-svelte.pages.dev/routes that:
            - Routes display correctly
            - Branch switching works
            - Stops load properly
